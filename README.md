# petulant-octo-hipster
An experimental image manipulation tool written in Go

First-milestone objectives are:
- Learning Go
- Reimplementing the basic JPEG glitching algorithm used for my photo courses (photos-glitch-experiment)

Then, as a second step:
- Add a web interface, multiple pictures at once.
- Implement other algorithms, either low-level (byte manipulations) or image level(random shifting of images? working with transparency/duplication? applying sound effects to images)
- In the process, develop/improve the necessary Go libraries.
